# BASH-scripts

A collection of BASH scripts I created for fun!..

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/baraaashraf/BASH-scripts.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the script's directory:
    ```bash
    cd BASH-scripts
    ```
3.Run the script:
  ```bash
  ./script-name
  ```
4.(optional) If you want you can directly copy these scripts to your system:
```bash
sudo cp -pv !(.git|.gitignore|README.md|LICENSE|*.sh) /usr/local/bin
```
After completing this steps, you should be able to execute the scripts from anywhere in the terminal by simply typing their names.
